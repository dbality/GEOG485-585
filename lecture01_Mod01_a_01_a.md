## Basics ##  {.module01}

### Outline ###  {.module01}

* What is Internet Mapping?

* Definitions

* Tools

### What is Internet Mapping ###  {.module01}

*Extended Desktop Mapping*

: 	Use of open standards based remote data and map services in desktop applications

*Geospatial Data Sharing*

:	Establishing open standards based services to share geospatial data and mapping capabilities over the Internet

*Web-client Mapping*

:	The delivery of mapping and geospatial data tools through web browsers, again based upon open standards

### Definitions ###  {.module01}

Internet

:	The global computer network of computers that typically connect with each other over TCP/IP

World Wide Web

:	The subset of applications that are run over the Internet, typically using the HTTP protocol in combination with data (HTML, XML, XHTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript) components

Mapping

:	The generation of cartographic products that include map images (pictures of geospatial data) and other elements (e.g. legends, tools, scale information, north-arrow)

Analysis

:	The development of models (statistical and otherwise) that enable the exploration of geospatial data and testing of hypotheses using those data

Open Standards

:	While the definition varies from one organization to the next, Open Standards are often characterized by the following:

* Developed through a public process by a national or international standards group
* May be implemented royalty-free

Interoperability

:	Ability of systems to share data and information with each other

COTS

:	Commercial Off-the-Shelf Software. Applications that are “purchased” from vendors, often with license terms that restrict the use the software to the specific platform for which it is licensed. Often comes with implicit or explicit technical support

Open Source

:	Software licensed under terms that are consistent with the Open Source definition, which includes access to source code, and freedom to modify and redistribute

Data

:	Actual values associated with geographic locations. For example - numeric elevation values associated with locations within a Digital Elevation Model.

Metadata

:	Data about a particular data product or service. Metadata provide critical documentation that supports the discovery and use of data products and data and mapping services
