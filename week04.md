# Introduction# {#week04}

This week covers some additional topics related to the Google Maps API, particularly focusing on styling the Maps base maps using the [Create Map Style wizard](https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com) and integrating the javascript generated by the wizard into the base web page code developed last week; and, using [Google's Fusion Tables](http://www.google.com/fusiontables/public/tour/index.html) tool to create and manage tabular data for mapping and other visualization. We complete our work with the Maps API with an example of a more "real" example of a maps-enabled web page. 


*Expected Outcomes*

By the end of this class module you should be able to:

* Generate a Google Maps JSON style using the _Create Map Style Wizard_

* Integrate that JSON into your map client page for styled basemap display

You should also understand

* The potential of _Fusion Tables_ as an alternative source of data to integrate into a custom Google Map page

* The potential structure of an _operational_ web page, including the physical separation of page components (structure, presentation, behavior) into separate files 


*Key Concepts*

* Generating Google Maps styles

* Integrating styles into a Google Maps page

* Fusion tables as a data source for Google Maps maps

* Separation of structure, presentation, and behavior in web development

# Weekly Milestone - Styling of an Embedded Google Map# {#week04-milestone}

Make a free-standing web page based upon the Google Map that you created as part of last week's milestone. Use the Google [Create Map Style wizard](https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com) to define _at least_ three modified base map styles and integrate the JSON generated by the wizard into your new Google Map page.


# Deep Dive - Creation of a a Google Maps Web Page with Custom Points and Labels# {#week04-deepDive}

In your milestone for this week you built a styled Google Maps base map for a particular region of interest. For this *deep dive* assignment create a new free-standing web page that includes a brief description of the topical focus of your mapper:

* The type of information that you want to depict in your map
* Your reasons for selecting the specific area shown in the map
* A description of what you are trying to communicate with the map

Embed the base map that you initially created for your milestone into this new web page.

* Add 5 overlay objects to the map that relate to specific items of interest or importance. These overlay objects may be _markers_, _polylines_, or _polygons_. Make sure to include descriptive titles for each object.
* Add an _infobox_ to each object that contains additional detailed information about the object
